= IPD 39 Datalink Media Types
{authors}

While we often talk about whether a link is up and what it's speed is,
there is another question that gets asked about: media. While we have
visibility about discrete, pluggable transceivers that shows up in topo,
this doesn't always cover the question of what type of media we are
using. As such, this IPD provides a bit of background and then goes into
a concrete proposal for how this should be implemented and exposed
through a combination of user tools and throughout the GLDv3 APIs that
we have.
